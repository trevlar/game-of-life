# Conways Game of Life

This React front end application implements a simulation of [Conway’s Game of Life Conway's Game of Life - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

[x] A way to play forever the next states 
[x] A way to advance x number of states 

The following additional requirements have been implemented:

[x] The edges of the board wrap to the other side
[x] A way to set the speed of the play through
[x] A way to set the size of the board
[x] A way to reset or clear the board
[x] A way to track the number of generations since the board was created
[x] A mobile friendly UI

Additional requirements not implemented:

[ ] A way to save and load a board

With a normal web service there might be an API, but the React app should take the place of the API. Include all code to simulate the Game of Life but treat that code as if it were going to be called from an API. Do not implement a backend API, unless you want to. 

This could take four to five hours. The implementation should be production ready. You don’t need to implement any authentication/authorization. Be ready to discuss your solution.
